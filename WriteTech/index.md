#### X formerly known as Twitter is a popular social media platform that allows you to share and discover content in real-time. Whether you want to connect and chat with friends, follow your favorite celebrities, stay updated on the latest news, or promote your business or brand, Twitter has something for everyone. This tutorial will walk you through the basics of setting up and using a Twitter account.

1. ##### **Create Your Twitter Account:** Visit the [Twitter website](https://twitter.com) or download the Twitter mobile app from your app store. Two major ways to create a Twitter account is by either signing up to Twitter with your existing Google account or Apple ID. (This is usually a fast and straightforward process as your personal details from your Google or Apple accounts are automatically used to create the Twitter account for you.) or by filling in your name, email, and date of birth in the space provided after clicking on the "Create account" button.

##### After filling in your details, click on the "Next" button and then click on the "Sign Up" button. You'll be required to authenticate your account, this is a simple process to verify you're not a bot, it's usually in the form of simple puzzles like in the screenshot below.

</p>

##### After successfully solving the puzzle, you'll be sent a verification code to the email you used to create your account, copy and paste it into the space provided, and then create a password. Remember to make your password strong but simple enough to easily remember. After creating your password you'll be asked to add a profile picture and username, you can however skip these two steps till you're ready to have them. The last step would be to pick at least 3 niches you're interested in and to follow at least 1 Twitter account.

2. ##### **Customize your profile:** Your profile will look like that of a bot if you don't customize it. Make it relatable by clicking on "Set up profile" as in the screenshot below.

##### Add a profile picture and a header (a larger image that appears at the top of your profile. It's a great opportunity to express your personality or showcase something you're passionate about.), choose something that represents you, like your face, your pet, or a funky emoji. Pick a unique username, also known as your Twitter handle. This will be preceded by the "@" symbol (e.g., @YourUsername). Make a short bio to describe yourself or your interests. You're limited to 160 characters, so make it concise and engaging. Add your location and click on "Save". You can always edit your profile anytime you like.

3. ##### **Make your first Tweet:** You can't call yourself a Tweep without a Tweet. To make your first Tweet, click the blue "+" icon, which can be found on the Twitter home page, and then click on the blue "Quill" icon. Compose your message, you can include text, polls, location, images, videos, GIFs, and links. Remember, you're limited to 280 characters per tweet. Use hashtags (#) to categorize your tweets and make them discoverable by people interested in those topics. Mention other users by typing "@" followed by their username (e.g., @YourFriend).

4. ##### **Explore Twitter features:** You can explore Twitter features in your own time to become conversant with the platform but for a bit of guidance, in the screenshot below, the first "House" icon is the Twitter home page and feed, Your Twitter feed displays tweets from users and accounts you follow and pages whose tweets are in the niches you're interested in. Scroll through your feed to see updates, news, and content from them. You can like tweets by clicking the heart icon, retweet them to share with your followers, or reply to engage in conversations. 

##### the "Lens" icon is the search bar, use it to look for specific users, topics, hashtags, or trending discourses. The "People" icon is for "communities" which is basically a group of tweeps who share the same interests so find your community and join them. The "Bell" icon is the notifications. It tells you when someone follows or mentions you, likes, retweets, or comments on your tweet, and when those you follow make new tweets. The "Envelope" icon is for your direct messages. Here you can chat with other tweeps.
